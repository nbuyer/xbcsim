# xbcsim
This project was developed using the Delphi programming language to ​simulate keyboard and mouse input using an Xbox game controller. Its purpose is to allow the controller to function as a computer remote, mimicking the behavior of a keyboard and mouse.

这个项目是以Delphi语言用XBox游戏手柄模拟键盘和鼠标输入, 其作用是让手柄像键盘/鼠标一样作为电脑遥控器使用.
